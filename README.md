# Text-Adventure-Game
A text-based adventure game i developed for a project.
It is somewhat simple in the gameplay, but has some really cool functions such as being able to generate levels based on specifications in text (.txt) files.

Have a go! (Compile with "make", and make sure you have C++11 installed!)
